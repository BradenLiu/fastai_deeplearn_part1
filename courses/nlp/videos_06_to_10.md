### regex
- use `assert` to check test cases
- instead of writing `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` we can write `[0-9]` or `\d`

A **Bloom filter** is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set. The price paid for this efficiency is that a Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure: it tells us that the element either definitely is not in the set or may be in the set.
