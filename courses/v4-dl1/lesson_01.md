- course will be released in July
- supposed to be the official version (now **v4**)
- book: [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD ](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527)

## Homework
- [Lesson 1 Homework](https://forums.fast.ai/t/did-you-do-the-homework/660340)

- [x] make sure you can spin up a GPU server
- [x] that you can shut it down when it is finished
- [ ] run the code shown in the lecture
- [ ] use the documentation, use the doc function inside juypter notebook
- [ ] do some searching of the fast.ai docs
- [ ] see if you can grab the fast.ai documentation notebooks and try running them
- [ ] read a chapter of the fast.ai book 11
- [ ] do the questionnaire at the end of the chapter (not everything has been covered yet, answer only the questions that you can)
- [ ] try to get comfortable with running code

## Paperspace
- fastai: [Getting Started with Gradient](https://course.fast.ai/start_gradient.html)
- fastai: v4 [Paperspace (free, paid options)](https://forums.fast.ai/t/platform-paperspace-free-paid-options/65515)

### My steps on Paperspace
1.  notebook:  https://www.paperspace.com/telmjtws3/notebook/prjrrhy56
2.  Open terminal, via Jupyter Notebook
- type `bash` to get a regular terminal (autocomplete, etc)
- `pip install fastai2 fastcore --upgrade`
- `cd course-v4`
- `git pull`


## Logistics
- edited video will be available in 1-2 days
- whatever you ask on the forum, it will eventually be public
- it's not personal if your post gets deleted from forums, it's for the readability of the forums
- 800 most valued members of community taking course
- at 9:40pm EST, there are **441** people watching
- at 9:45pm EST, **465**
- at 10:00pm EST, **483**
- at 111:45pm EST, **434**
- at 12am, **405**

## Forums
- can select "none" to remove study group threads
- study group:  research shows doing work in a group are much more likely to create powerful, long-term projects
- will set up virtual study groups

## COVID-19
- blog: [Covid-19, your community, and you â€” a data science perspective](https://www.fast.ai/2020/03/09/coronavirus/)
- published:  09-Mar-2020

10:33 break

## Getting Started
- AGI:  Artificial General Intelligence
- Neural networks:  a brief history
- 1986:  MIT released book on Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP)
- 

## Education at Bat: 7 Principals for Educators
Professor David Perkins uses his childhood baseball experiences:  
1. Play the whole game
2. Make the game worth playing
3. Work on the hard parts

You will be practicing things that are hard.  Requires:
- tenacity
- committment
- will need to work damn hard
- spend less time on theory, and MORE time on running models and with code

## Software Stack
- fastai
- PyTorch
- Python

## PyTorch
- Tensorflow got bogged down
- PyTorch was easier to use
- in last 12 months, % of papers that use PyTorch at conferences went from 20% to 80%
- industry moves slowly, but will catch up
- PyTorch:  very flexible, not designed for beginner-friendliness
  - doesn't have higher level libraries
  - fastai is the most popular higher level API for PyTorch
  - fastai uses a layered API
  
## To do work
- need GPU, Nvidia one
- use one of the platforms that is easily set up
- run it on Linux; it's hard enough to learn deep learning w/o archane solutions
- app_jupyter.ipynb:  learn about Jupyter notebook
- REPL:  Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

## Jupyter Notebook
- shift + enter:  to run
- Workflow:  select notebook, duplicate it and rename it 
- fastbook repository: all text from book 
- course-v4 --> this removes all text, leaves just code
- at the end of notebooks, there are Questionnaires
  - What do we want you to take away from each notebook?
  - What should you know before you move on?
  - Do questionnaire before moving on to each chapter
  - If you missed something, do go back and read it
  - If you do get stuck after a couple of times, then do move on to next chapter and you might understand it better later
  - File / Trust Notebook 
- `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager`

## 
- deep learning is a kind of machine learning
- 

## Limitations Inherent to Machine Learning
- 

## Consider how a model interacts with its environment
- PROXY:  arrest is a proxy for crime [listen to this again]
- 

## Homework
1. spin up a GPU server
2. run code
3. search fastai docs
4. try to get comfortable, know your way around
5. read chapter of book
6. go through questionnaire
