- [x] run the code shown in the lecture
- [x] use the documentation, use the doc function inside juypter notebook
- [x] do some searching of the fast.ai docs
- [ ] see if you can grab the fast.ai documentation notebooks and try running them

## Referencing Documentation in Jupyter Notebook

#### `?` OR `??` gives interactive python guide  (abbreviated output below. [full doc output](doc_01_reference.md))

```text
IPython -- An enhanced Interactive Python
=========================================

IPython offers a fully compatible replacement for the standard Python
interpreter, with convenient shell features, special commands, command
history mechanism and output results caching.

At your system command line, type 'ipython -h' to see the command line
options available. This document only describes interactive features.

GETTING HELP
------------

Within IPython you have various way to access help:

  ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features (this screen).
  object?   -> Details about 'object'.
  object??  -> More detailed, verbose information about 'object'.
  %quickref -> Quick reference of all IPython specific syntax and magics.
  help      -> Access Python's own help system.

If you are in terminal IPython you can quit this screen by pressing `q`.

## Getting Started
- AGI:  Artificial General Intelligence
- Neural networks:  a brief history
- 1986:  MIT released book on Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP)
- 

## Education at Bat: 7 Principals for Educators
Professor David Perkins uses his childhood baseball experiences:  
1. Play the whole game
2. Make the game worth playing
3. Work on the hard parts

You will be practicing things that are hard.  Requires:
- tenacity
- committment
- will need to work damn hard
- spend less time on theory, and MORE time on running models and with code

## Software Stack
- fastai
- PyTorch
- Python

## PyTorch
- Tensorflow got bogged down
- PyTorch was easier to use
- in last 12 months, % of papers that use PyTorch at conferences went from 20% to 80%
- industry moves slowly, but will catch up
- PyTorch:  very flexible, not designed for beginner-friendliness
  - doesn't have higher level libraries
  - fastai is the most popular higher level API for PyTorch
  - fastai uses a layered API
  
## To do work
- need GPU, Nvidia one
- use one of the platforms that is easily set up
- run it on Linux; it's hard enough to learn deep learning w/o archane solutions
- app_jupyter.ipynb:  learn about Jupyter notebook
- REPL:  Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

## Jupyter Notebook
- shift + enter:  to run
- Workflow:  select notebook, duplicate it and rename it 
- fastbook repository: all text from book 
- course-v4 --> this removes all text, leaves just code
- at the end of notebooks, there are Questionnaires
  - What do we want you to take away from each notebook?
  - What should you know before you move on?
  - Do questionnaire before moving on to each chapter
  - If you missed something, do go back and read it
  - If you do get stuck after a couple of times, then do move on to next chapter and you might understand it better later
  - File / Trust Notebook 
- `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager`

## 
- deep learning is a kind of machine learning
- 

## Limitations Inherent to Machine Learning
- 

## Consider how a model interacts with its environment
- PROXY:  arrest is a proxy for crime [listen to this again]
- 

## Homework
1. spin up a GPU server
2. run code
3. search fastai docs
4. try to get comfortable, know your way around
5. read chapter of book
6. go through questionnaire
